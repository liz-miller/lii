  subtitle: "A Robotics Engineer & Entrepreneur"
  description: "I'm the founder of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.learnrobotics.org'>Learn Robotics</a>, the #1 edTech site designed to help people gain robotics skills. Welcome to my technical consulting website. I created Freedom in Tech (FiT) as a way to help Startups and Small Businesses. As an entrepreneur, myself, I understand how tricky it is to wear a bunch of hats. If you're not technically-inclined or you need extra support, you can hire me as your acting CTO, Director of Ops, or Part-Time Tech Manager. I am now taking on additional clients for 2021. <br><b>Contact me below to see if we're a good fit!</b>"
